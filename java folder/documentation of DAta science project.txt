📌 Project Report – AI Data-Driven Sensitive Data Exposure Analyzer
🔹 Project Overview

In today’s digital world, sensitive user information (such as passwords, medical records, financial data, or personal identification details) is frequently collected and stored by organizations. While encryption and masking are widely used, poor implementation or insecure handling often leads to data exposure risks.

The AI Data-Driven Sensitive Data Exposure Analyzer is designed to detect, analyze, and prevent sensitive data exposure using AI, ML, and cryptography. The tool scans datasets, classifies sensitive information, applies encryption, and provides risk analysis to ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

🔹 Problem Statement

Companies often mishandle sensitive data, storing it without proper encryption.

Existing encryption methods may be outdated or insecure.

Sensitive data (like credit card numbers, SSNs, passwords, or health data) can be leaked due to poor access controls.

Manual audits are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

This project aims to solve these issues by creating a data security analyzer powered by AI and cryptography.

🔹 Objectives

Detect sensitive data automatically using ML models.

Classify and categorize data into types (PII, PHI, Financial, Authentication, etc.).

Encrypt sensitive data securely with Fernet (AES-based encryption).

Analyze risk levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low exposure).

Provide visualization dashboard to monitor exposure patterns.

Enable future integration with cloud platforms for large-scale deployment.

🔹 Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

cryptography → for encryption/decryption

scikit-learn → for ML-based classification

pandas, numpy → for data processing

matplotlib, seaborn → for visualization

tkinter / streamlit → for GUI/dashboard

Machine Learning Models:

Naïve Bayes / Random Forest (for detecting sensitive patterns in text/data)

Cloud (future scope): AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud DLP

🔹 Internal Technical Workflow

Data Input: CSV/Excel/Text files uploaded.

Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing dataset.

Sensitive Data Detection (AI):

Regex + ML model to identify sensitive fields (Emails, Credit Cards, Aadhaar, PAN, Passwords).

Encryption Module:

Uses Fernet (AES-128) to encrypt identified sensitive values.

Secure storage of secret keys.

Risk Analyzer:

Scores exposure risk based on data type & storage practices.

Flags insecure encryption or unmasked values.

Dashboard:

Graphs showing risk levels, sensitive data categories, and encryption status.

🔹 External (Real-World Relevance)

Industries Benefited:

Banking (protecting credit card, account details).

Healthcare (protecting patient health records).

E-commerce (securing payment information).

Government (securing Aadhaar, SSNs, PAN).

Motivation:
Data breaches (like Facebook–Cambridge Analytica, Aadhaar leaks, Equifax) show the urgent need for AI-driven security solutions.

Compliance Support:

Ensures data handling meets GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 standards.
